                    Have you got colour in your cheeks?<br>
                    Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift <br>
                    The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?<br>
                    Are there some aces up your sleeve?<br>
                    Have you no idea that you're in deep?<br>
                    I dreamt about you nearly every night this week<br>
                    <br><br>
                    How many secrets can you keep?<br>
                    'Cause there's this tune I found<br>
                    That makes me think of you somehow<br>
                    And I play it on repeat<br>
                    Until I fall asleep<br>
                    Spilling drinks on my settee<br>
                    <br><br>
                    (Do I wanna know)<br>
                    If this feeling flows both ways?<br>
                    (Sad to see you go)<br>
                    Was sorta hoping that you’d stay<br>
                    (Baby, we both know)<br>
                    That the nights were mainly made<br>
                    For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day<br>

                    Crawling back to you<br>
                    Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?<br>
                    'Cause I always do<br>
                    Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new<br>
                    Now, I've thought it through<br>
                    Crawling back to you<br>

                    So, have you got the guts?<br>
                    Been wondering if your heart's still open<br>
                    And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts<br>
                    Simmer down and pucker up<br>
                    I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly <br>
                    on the cusp Of trying to kiss you<br>
                    I don't know if you feel the same as I do<br>
                    But we could be together if you wanted to<br>

                    (Do I wanna know)<br>
                    If this feeling flows both ways?<br>

                    (You've had a few?)<br>
                    'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)<br>
                    Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)<br>
                    Busy being yours (being yours)<br>
                    To fall for somebody new<br>
                    Now, I've thought it through<br>
